  This should be done, there mignt need to be some leftover stuff.

Hyde kind of defeats the point of not going with a DE, I should rip out the guts and keep what i need

** TODO Waybar configuration without hyde
** TODO See if we can bind the thumb button to LGUI
** TODO mouse sens is odd, double scrolling as well
** TODO delay before key repeat should be less
* Emacs [1/3]
** TODO remove things that I don't know what they do
** TODO Projectile switch action should let me choose between a few options
I want to choose between fuzzy finding, opening the project term, opening project dired, or magit-status
** Bugs / Behavior I don't like [0/2]
*** TODO non-included documents aren't being added unless eglot is restarted
*** TODO ~n~ and ~e~ open files in compilation-mode instead of scrolling output
I think this is probably becuse of some underlying binding that binds ~C-n~ and ~C-p~ to something that navigates to errors instead of scrolling
** Org [0/1]
*** change the colors of the todo labels
*** TODO Get started with org-roam

**** TODO track-changes-mode is logging errors on document change
#+begin_src
Warning (emacs): Missing/incorrect calls to ‘before/after-change-functions’!!

This also causes corfu to crash, complaining about the problems with track changes

*** TODO Change keybindings for split management
Ideally, I want something more like vim's ~C-w <key>~ as opposed to the ~C-x <digit>~ convention.

I think theres a snippet in the meow FAQs about doing this exactly...
*** OBSOLETE can we set up use-package integration?
- State "OBSOLETE"   from "TODO"       [2024-11-04 Mon 17:22] \\
  already can be implemented using :bind (:map meow-STATE-state-map (...))
