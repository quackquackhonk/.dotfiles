  Im just gonna use tofi
** Hyprland [0/1]
*** TODO Better workspace management
Ideally, I want one workspace per app (roughly)
- so pressing ~S-e~ should not only open emacs, it should also switch to the "emacs" workspace
- This should NOT double open programs, if its already running, just switch
** Done waybar
- State "DONE"       from              [2024-12-12 Thu 16:41]
** DONE steam
* Hyprland [4/5]
** DONE TARTED Get off HyDE
- State "DONE"       from              [2024-12-12 Thu 16:40]
- State "STARTED"    from "TODO"       [2024-11-07 Thu 18:27]
  This should be done, there mignt need to be some leftover stuff.

Hyde kind of defeats the point of not going with a DE, I should rip out the guts and keep what i need

** DONE Waybar configuration without hyde
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-03-10 Mon 13:26]

** DONE mouse sens is odd, double scrolling as well
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-05-05 Mon 18:31]
** TODO delay before key repeat should be less
* Emacs [2/3]
** Figure out persistent tabs with perspective-mode
I don't like persp-mode and its projcetile integration, I want to move back to perspective

I should be able to just fork the main perspective mode and adjust the persp struct to add tabs
** DONE remove things that I don't know what they do
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-05-05 Mon 18:31]
** TODO Projectile switch action should let me choose between a few options
I want to choose between fuzzy finding, opening the project term, opening project dired, or magit-status
** Bugs / Behavior I don't like [0/2]
*** TODO non-included documents aren't being added unless eglot is restarted
*** TODO ~n~ and ~e~ open files in compilation-mode instead of scrolling output
I think this is probably becuse of some underlying binding that binds ~C-n~ and ~C-p~ to something that navigates to errors instead of scrolling

*** TODO Change keybindings for split management
Ideally, I want something more like vim's ~C-w <key>~ as opposed to the ~C-x <digit>~ convention.

I think theres a snippet in the meow FAQs about doing this exactly...
*** OBSOLETE can we set up use-package integration?
- State "OBSOLETE"   from "TODO"       [2024-11-04 Mon 17:22] \\
