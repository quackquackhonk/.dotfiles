** Hyprland [0/4]
*** STARTED Get off HyDE
- State "STARTED"    from "TODO"       [2024-11-07 Thu 18:27]
  This should be done, there mignt need to be some leftover stuff.

Hyde kind of defeats the point of not going with a DE, I should rip out the guts and keep what i need

*** TODO Waybar configuration without hyde
*** TODO See we we can bind the thumb button to LGUI
*** TODO delay before key repeat should be less
** Emacs [2/5]
*** TODO remove things that I don't know what they do
*** TODO split up linux / macos / terminal settings
*** Development Settings [0/1]
**** TODO C / C++ [0/3]
***** TODO Debugging
PRIMARILY need lldb support
***** TODO track-changes-mode is logging errors on document change
#+begin_src
Warning (emacs): Missing/incorrect calls to ‘before/after-change-functions’!!
Details logged to ‘track-changes--error-log’
#+end_src
***** TODO non-included documents aren't being added unless eglot is restarted
*** DONE flatten the config
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-11-04 Mon 17:31]
*** Keybindings [3/5]
**** DONE surround integration
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-11-07 Thu 18:26]
**** DONE prefix maps in meow normal mode
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2024-11-08 Fri 13:45]
~g~ and ~z~ prefix maps?
**** TODO custom meow "things"
***** DONE angled brackets <>
- State "DONE"       from "WAITING"    [2024-11-07 Thu 18:26]
***** TODO single quotes ''
***** TODO backticks ``
**** TODO Change keybindings for split management
Ideally, I want something more like vim's ~C-w <key>~ as opposed to the ~C-x <digit>~ convention.

I think theres a snippet in the meow FAQs about doing this exactly...
**** OBSOLETE can we set up use-package integration?
- State "OBSOLETE"   from "TODO"       [2024-11-04 Mon 17:22] \\
  already can be implemented using :bind (:map meow-STATE-state-map (...))
*** Theming / UI
**** TODO display-buffer customization
- [ ] compilation buffer always in a new tab, switch back on "close"
- [ ] ~eat-project~ as full horizontal split
- [ ] ~eat~ in a new tab (auto close tab)
- [ ] magit buffer in new tab (auto close tab)
**** TODO Modeline configuration

Ideally is should be layed out as

| meow mode | buffer | major mode |  empty space | active environment | vc branch | project |
**** TODO hl-todo customizations
- [ ] Swap the background / foreground of current todo highlighting
- [ ] Explore changing the entire /comment/ to the highlight color
