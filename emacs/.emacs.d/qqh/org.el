;;; Org-mode is a fantastically powerful package. It does a lot of things, which
;;; makes it a little difficult to understand at first.
;;;
;;; We will configure Org-mode in phases. Work with each phase as you are
;;; comfortable.
;;;
;;; YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE SOME VARIABLES! The most important variable is the
;;; `org-directory', which tells org-mode where to look to find your agenda
;;; files.

;;; See "org-intro.txt" for a high-level overview.

;;; Contents:
